### Q&A notes
- A [livestream](https://youtu.be/cHr9qGPHdiA?t=1214) of work from previous RunwayML student work (the first 20min have a lot of technical issues, so I’m linking past that)
- [A playlist of dataset scraping tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs9v81cWpRC7nm94eTMtohHq)
- [Sam Lavigne is running a webscraping newsletter](https://twitter.com/sam_lavigne/status/1261794434619973634)

### Homework
- **Play with the models in Runway**
  - Find a model to explore
  - In the class Slack tell us the following:
    - What model you used
    - What the inputs and outputs were
    - What questions you have about the model
    - Show us what you made!
- **Think about a bigger project you want to make**
  - Look at the Runway Slack and social projects for inspiration
  - Look at some of the models and consider what inputs you have available to you and what you want as outputs
  
## Week 2

### Q&A notes
- [Deep Dream demo and notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvOI_u0khTs&t=2s) (I prefer this to the Runway model, but admit it’s more cumbersome)
- [StyleGAN model trained on video frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_i05fAAnlY)
- [A demo on turned video into frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck11jOVYlIw)
- [Naoko’s Lamp Generator](https://youtu.be/cHr9qGPHdiA?t=1551)
- lots of good imagery to work with in the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary)
- TK: A full walkthrough of the neural-style-tf model on Runway.

### Homework
- **Start thinking about datasets**
  - Watch some of the [dataset videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs9v81cWpRC7nm94eTMtohHq)
  - If you want to make a personal dataset or something by hand, start collecting!
  - If you’ve never done scraping before, I might recommend looking for Instagram accounts ([Instagram is the easiest to scrape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBmQcdLLFyc&list=PLWuCzxqIpJs9v81cWpRC7nm94eTMtohHq&index=10))
- **Keep exploring models**
  - We’ve covered a handful of models so far in class, but there are many more! Keep digging around.
  
  
## Week 3

  - Make your own!
  - Scrape your own! 
  - Find a premade one on the internet. 
  - Don’t care about datasets? Let me know if you want a premade one from us.
