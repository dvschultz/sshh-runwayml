### Homework
- *Play with the models in Runway*
  - Find a model to explore
  - In the class Slack tell us the following:
    - What model you used
    - What the inputs and outputs were
    - What questions you have about the model
    - Show us what you made!
- *Think about a bigger project you want to make*
  - Look at the Runway Slack and social projects for inspiration
  - Look at some of the models and consider what inputs you have available to you and what you want as outputs
